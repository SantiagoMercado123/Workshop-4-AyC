Synopsis: Creates a file with n random integers, then all those arrays are transfered to an array. The program reads each element in the array and stores the unique numbers in a different array. It also counts the amount of times each unique number appears, and prints the information to the user. This process is done at least 200 times for every file with n integers in order to find the average runtime for the program given. It also forces the best case (all n integers are 0) to analize it and compare it to the average and worst case (n different numbers).
